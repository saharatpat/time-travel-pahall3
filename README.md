I am learning about making a magazine in a Git repository.

We ignore build outputs (target/) and OS files to keep the repository clean and avoid pushing unnecessary files.
- `author/idea-sprint`: fast drafting of zine content and ideas.
- `editor/review`: edits, language cleanup, and approvals before merging to `main`.
